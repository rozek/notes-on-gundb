# notes-on-gundb #

a (growing) collection of notes on GunDB

[GunDB](https://github.com/amark/gun) is a decentralized (peer-to-peer) distributed [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) with support for multiple users, access control and persistence. It runs in the browser or on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), works fine when offline and synchronizes with other peers using a "last-write-wins" strategy when online

While GunDB might be brilliant in some aspects, the docs are a complete nightmare (incomplete, wrong, spread over many separate documents). This repository therefore contains a collection of the author's notes on GunDB as he starts learning and evaluating it.

> **First of all: do not use `https://gun.eco/docs` - use the [GunDB wiki](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki) instead, it's much better**
